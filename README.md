## What's this? 🤔

Hi there 👋! This is a landing page for HooBank, a fictitious app whose gorgeous design was created by [@adrianhajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin) and completed by their community over at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### ⚠ Warning ⚠

The `backdrop-filter: blur()` effect makes the colors look really off on Firefox, I'll try to implement it in a way that doesn't make the website look like it was made up by a clown...
